\begin{enumerate}
  \item Open your file explorer in Ubuntu or any other similar Linux variant to the location        you would like to save your repository to.
  \item Right click and select ``open terminal here'' to open the terminal in this location.
  \item If you have never used github before, make sure to run the following commands: \\
  \framebox{\parbox{\textwidth}{git config -{}-global user.name                       Your\textunderscore Full\textunderscore Name \\
                    git config -{}-global user.email youremail@wit                     s.ac.za}}
\\
  where Your\textunderscore Full\textunderscore Name and youremail@wits.ac.za will be replaced with your own details.
  \item Now type the following: \\
  \framebox{git clone https:/github.com/jasonstuart/SE\textunderscore Project\textunderscore 2017.git}\\
  This will clone the current repository to your machine.
  
  \item At this point you can navigate into the created folder (which houses the repository). Currently, you will see a subdirectory called ``Documents'' which is where all our remaining documentation will be located.
